# Recurrent-Neural-Network
Implementations of RNN, GRU and Transformer models using Torch with forward, backprop capabilities. 
Use generate() functions in the models to generate sample outputs.

The driver file reads in a text corpus (in our testing Penn Treebank) and creates the requested language model based on the implementations.
